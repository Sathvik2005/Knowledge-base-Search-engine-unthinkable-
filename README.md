# Answer IQ: Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Search System

## 1. Abstract
**Answer IQ (RAG-Gemini)** is an intelligent knowledge base assistant built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** principles.  
The system enables users to upload unstructured data (PDF or text documents) and interact with it through natural language queries.

It integrates **document retrieval (semantic search)** and **response generation (transformer-based models)** to provide precise, context-aware answers.  
This project demonstrates the integration of **NLP, vector embeddings, and transformer-based generation** in a unified **Streamlit** web application.

## 2. Introduction
Modern enterprises handle massive volumes of unstructured text data that are difficult to query effectively.  
Traditional keyword-based search fails to capture semantic meaning, leading to inefficient retrieval.

**RAG-Gemini** addresses this problem by combining **information retrieval** with **generative reasoning** — retrieving relevant document chunks and generating concise or detailed answers using a **transformer-based language model**.  

This project serves as a foundation for **intelligent, domain-specific knowledge assistants** that function entirely offline — **no external API calls required**.

## 3. Objectives
- Enable users to upload and process multiple PDF or text documents for knowledge base creation.  
- Generate **vector embeddings** using transformer-based embedding models.  
- Perform **semantic retrieval** using **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**.  
- Generate **contextually relevant responses** using a local language model.  
- Support **both text and voice-based querying**.  
- Provide an **intuitive Streamlit interface** for real-time information exploration.

## 4. System Overview
The architecture follows the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** paradigm with three main components:

1. **Knowledge Base Construction** – Document ingestion, text segmentation, embedding generation.  
2. **Retriever Module** – FAISS-based similarity search over embeddings.  
3. **Synthesis Engine** – Transformer model generates final natural language responses.
